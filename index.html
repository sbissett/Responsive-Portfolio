                 <p>     I'm closer to 60 THAN 55! And although I may or may not be the oldest student in the class, I'm certainly feeling that
                         way with my coding ability. Never easy. Sometimes it seems like I'm trying to learn Greek...which I thought was one of
                         the hardest languages to learn. But after googling the hardest languages to master, Greek doesn't even make the top 10.  
                         We're talking Mandarin, Finnish and Navajo finish in the top 10 - NOT Greek. Now I'm feeling my age :-). But I digress.

                         <br>       
                         Some things I like to do... 
                         <br>       
                         <br>              
                        * Hiking with my son - 10,000 ft in altitude or higher is the benchmark.
                        <br>  

                         * Road Biking - Little Cottonwood Canyon.  It's a suffer fest and beyond category climb. 
                         <br>     
                         * Having quiet conversation with my wife - which is a rarity.
                         <br>      
                        * Mountain Biking - Quarry Trail to Tanner Flats.
                         <br>      
                        * Surfing-The cold waters of northern california; none of this warm water stuff for me.
                        <br>      
                        * Peacefully sitting on my deck. Even in the dead of winter!
